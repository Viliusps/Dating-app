# Running your React Native application

Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone
and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.
On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.
On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.

Go to `ui` directory and use `npm i` to get the latest modules.
Then from the same directory use `npx expo start`.
